# Lattice Nets Project

This project explores lattice-based neural networks.

## Setup

1. Install `uv` if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Initialize the environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter lab
   ```

## Structure

- `main.ipynb`: Principal exploration notebook.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project configuration and dependencies (managed by `uv`).
